<p>If you&rsquo;re traveling around Australia, I&rsquo;m sure that you will come across some typical Australian food. While you&rsquo;re here you really should try some of it! From meat you don&rsquo;t normally find in other supermarkets to chocolate biscuits, to the most common Australian food you should try.</p>

<h2>Vegemite</h2>

<p>Vegemite is the most common one that &lsquo;foreigners&rsquo; discover, and more often than not, hate! No matter how many people tell you it&rsquo;s disgusting you should try it at least once. It&rsquo;s an acquired taste&hellip; So what is Vegemite? Vegemite is a dark brown paste made from various vegetables, yeast extract and spice additives. The most popular way to eat it is on toast with butter. Australians also eat it with avocado, melted cheese or tomato. People think it tastes like syrup, but it tastes very salty and not sweet at all. Best way to eat it is with loads of butter and a thin spread of vegemite.</p>

<h2>Tim Tams</h2>

<p>Any backpacker who has traveled through Australia will have tried Australia&#39;s favourite chocolate biscuit&hellip; the Tim Tam. If you eat one, it&rsquo;s hard not to eat a second or third! I think you must become addicted. The best way to eat them is the Tim Tam slam: bite the diagonal corners off the Tim Tam and take a cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate. Use the Tim Tam as a straw and suck the drink through the biscuit. Then before it gets too soggy, and falls into your drink, you eat the soft, gooey chocolatey goodness.</p>

<h2>Meat Pies</h2>

<p>Pies are a popular snack to eat on the go and almost every corner shop, bakery and supermarket will have a display case with lots of hot meaty pies to choose from. There are even specialty pie shops! Australians have many different savoury pies you can buy, however they are usually stuffed with minced meat, gravy, mushrooms, onions and cheese. It&rsquo;s also a good snack after a long night of partying. After drinking and dancing you end the night with a meat pie in your hand, sitting on the pavement waiting for your taxi to go home.</p>

<h2>Kangaroo</h2>

<p>While visitors usually take pictures of kangaroos bouncing around, the kangaroo is also a common meat to be found on supermarket shelves and restaurant menus. Kangaroo is lean red meat, it&rsquo;s healthy and you can prepare it in many ways &ndash; steaks, burgers, sausages, and much more.</p>
